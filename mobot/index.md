# MoBot

MoBot is a modular, extensible Discord bot framework built in Java. It's designed to give developers full control over bot behavior through a clean and powerful API, while keeping setup and module development approachableâ€”even for beginners.

At its core, MoBot supports a plugin-like architecture that allows you to build and manage independent modules, each with its own logic, commands, event listeners, and dependencies. Whether you're creating small utilities or full-featured systems, MoBot provides the structure and flexibility to support your ideas.

Modules are easy to configure and hot-load, and the framework handles startup order, logging, and lifecycle management out of the box. With a strong focus on developer experience, MoBot includes detailed documentation and examples to help you get started quickly.
